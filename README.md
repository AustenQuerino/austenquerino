### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Austen
#### Backend Developer and Financial Professional
I'm Austen from Canada, and I am a Backend developer who loves working with data. I really enjoy learning programming languages and frameworks like Python and SQL as well as JavaScript.

Skills: Python/ JavaScript/ SQL/ HTML/ CSS/ VBA/ Docker/ Flask/ Django/ Docker 

I am an investment professional who has worked in the financial services industry for more than 6 years. Attending the University of Western Ontario from 2011 to 2015, I graduated with a Bachelor of Management and Organizational Studies with a Specialization in Finance. Right out of University I worked for one of the big five banks in Canada, TD Bank where I learned a lot about the banking industry. Although my time in retail banking was a great learning experience, I was more intrigued by the investment and asset management industry and was employed by an early-stage asset manager called Crimson Asset Management. Crimson was a spine-off from a more established asset manager called Burgundy Asset Management. At Crimson I was employee number two which required me to wear many different hats. I was part of the investment team where we did research in public small-cap North American companies using DCF model construction along with industry analysis. I also worked on the fund accounting to ensuring our portfolios we reconciled. As the team was small, I was also on the pitch/sales team to introduce the company to prospectus investors. 

I was later head-hunted by a medium size asset management firm ($77b AUM) called Connor Clark & Lunn (CC&L) Financial Group where I work for the Private Capital affiliate. There I conducted research and analysis to identify and evaluate investment opportunities in a broad spectrum of asset classes including public and private equities, real estate, infrastructure, private debt, and even quantitative and algorithmic strategies. At CC&L we work with institutional and large private clients including family offices, foundations, endowments, charities, and Aboriginal Communities. 

Although I have worked solely in the financial industry, I do also have a strong interest in technology and the power of computer programming. This interest has led me to enrol in the Nucamp Coding Bootcamp for Backend Development. This bootcamp includes three sections: 1. Python fundamentals, data structures and algorithms, 2. SQL with Python, Postgres, Docker, Flask, Django and SDLC, CI/CD, 3. DevOps including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud/Firestone. With these powerful tools I am able to create code that makes my tasks more efficient and myself more productive.
